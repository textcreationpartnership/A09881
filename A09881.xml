            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Therefore was the King commanded to take a coppy of the law, to haue it by him, and to read in it all the daies of his life; that he might learne to feare the Lord his God, to obſerue all his words and ſtatutes by doing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that his minde might not be lift vp aboue his brethren, nor he depart from the law, to the right hand or to the left; that he might prolong his daies in his kingdome, &amp; his ſonnes in the midſt of Iſrael. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18.19.20.</p>

But a Papiſt, that houlds a faith &amp; doctrine, the maximes and rules whereof are oppoſite to the ſtate and dignity of Princes, though they alleadge a thouſand times, they ſtand but for their conſcience &amp; religion: yet becauſe their conſcience and religion is ſuch, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and grounds of it, are contrary to all States &amp; aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the Magiſtrate cannot endure ſuch a conſcience and religion, without the certaine danger of having the mace and ſcepter wrong out of his hands.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Many points of Popiſh doctrine were challenged even in the Primitiue Church, (for even at that time the myſtery of iniquitie began to worke) to bee falſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. Paul challenged the falſe-teachers, which taught

The Apoſtle ſaieth that Antichriſt ſhal <hi>worke ſecretly the myſtery of iniquitie.</hi> Wherefore is that iniquitie tearmed a <hi>myſterie,</hi> if it were manifeſt, and eaſie to be eſpyed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Our Saviour Chriſt foretelleth, that many ſhall worke ſuch miracles, for confirmation of their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as ſhould be able, if it were poſſible, to deceiue the very elect. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When the huſband-man was a ſleepe, the enemie
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5420:24"/>ſowed tares, in the night, and went his way. The morning came, the tares were not eſpyed; no, they were not eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſpring-time, but grew togither with the wheat, and ſeemed all this while to be good wheate. At laſt, the blade appeared, and brought forth fruit; and then appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the tares alſo: Now they were diſcerned and never before. Then came the Servants of the houſholder, and ſaid vnto him; <hi>Maſter, ſowedſt thou not good ſeede in thy field? from whence hath it tares?</hi> And he ſaid to them. <hi>Some envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man hath done this. Matth.</hi> 13.24.25.26.27.28. Even ſo, when Chriſt our Saviour, ſowed the ſeed of eternall life, the doctrine of the Goſpell; the Enemy, the Divell (the auctor of Poperie) ſowed tares amongſt the good ſeed, even covertly and ſecretly hee ſowed errours &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, whileſt men feared no ſuch danger: But nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing growne vp, being ripe and rotten, we diſcerne them to be tares and hereſies indeed. The Papiſts oftentimes obiect:
<hi>If our doctrine be errour and hereſie, then tell vs vvhen it came in, who was the auctor of it, vnder what Pope or Emperor was it firſt taught?</hi> We anſwere, to know this, is not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; neither indeed doe we know, who was the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (immediatly next vnto Sathan) and founder of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of their blaſphemous opinions. But this we know, that our Maſters ſeed which hee ſowed, was perfit and good: whatſoever elſe commeth vp with it, which is not of the ſeed, we are ſure, it is a ſtincking weed, a vile graine fitter for beaſts and divels, then for men: and not the fine wheate, the fruit of the precious ſeed of our Maſter. We can neither tell by whom, nor at what time,<note place="margin">5.

            </head>
            <p>ALAS, alas deare GOD! Be there yet any left that pleade for Baal! Haſt thou not taught vs, &amp; revealed vnto vs the impietie and iniquitie, the infidelitie and irreligion of the Profeſſion now vrged! Haue not we, after diligent inquirie, deprehended it to be Idolatrie, Blaſphemie and Prophanation of thy name: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the worſhip of Idols of bread, wood, ſtone; by their iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations through their owne workes, and ſo many other by meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that only ſweete Sacrifice of thy Sonne; and by their falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which is not a Service preſcribed by thy worde, but a meere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of vnpure, carnall, profane and divelliſh wits! Have not we founde the doctrine and practiſe of it, as a Sea of Sin, to be the cauſe of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie, diſhoneſtie and wicked converſation amongſt men: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in that Antichriſtian Supremacie, whereby the Man of Sinne, in the divelliſh pride of his harte and ſeate, challengeth vnto himſelfe fulnes of power, and ſoveraignety of iuriſdiction to doe what pleaſeth him in heaven, in earth and in hell, to diſpenſe with what he liſt! What greater encouragement can there be to ſinne, then that a man may be ſure for a little money, to haue a ſealed pardon, not onely for any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, but alſo for al he ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte during his life &amp; many hundred yeeres after? So abſurdly wicked is their doctrine &amp; practiſe. If by going on pilgrimage, ſaying ſo many times over his beads, faſting ſo many daies, giving ſo much vnto Monkes &amp; Friers, or maintaining ſo many Maſſes, a man may ſatisfie for his ſinnes, and appeaſe thy wrath, ô GOD, againſt the ſame; who will be reſtrained from any wickednes, or be carefull for amending his life? But no marveile though ſo infinite a power of the Pope be ſo great a cauſe of ſinne; ſeeing the auctoritie of abſolution, which every Popiſh Prieſt hath, is ſo fruitful in this kind, to the incouragement and increaſe of wickednes. we haue but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny woefull examples, of ſuch who abſolved their diſciples before hand, to poyſon and to murder the ſacred perſons of our Kings and Princes, thine Anoynted, If every Prieſt hath ſuch a power to abſolve from ſinne, what wickednes is there which theſe Abſolvers will not diſpenſe with; and what ſecurity for an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What ſhal I ſpeake of their Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuaries, priviledged places, exemptions, immunities, appeales and protections, which muſt needes, by impunity, provoke men vnto all wickedneſſe? It is as cleare as the Sunne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both through thy Iuſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How long, ô Lord, how long wilt thou endure theſe Lovers of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon! How long wilt thou ſuffer them to profane thy name, to defile thy ſanctuarie, and to ſeduce thy Children! We, thy poore Servants in the Vniverſities, may write til our ſtrength faileth vs, preach yea cry out till we haue loſt our voices, and mourne till our hartes breake, in defence of thy eternall truth, againſt Popiſh Antichriſtianiſme: Yet vntill the Miniſtrie of thy Word be eſtabliſhed in every part of our Land, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rootes therof wil never be cleane pulled vp. Thou knoweſt, ô GOD, that ſome of the Ambaſſadours of thy Sonne are ſufficiently provided for; and we ſee and feele to our great griefe that our Miniſtrie in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yea in moſt places, is vnprouided, contrary to thy commandement, and to the iuſt cauſe of feare of thy indignation againſt vs for it, if it bee not ſome way in time relieved. But this ſpecially ariſeth of the ſpoile which the children of Babylon in times paſt haue made by impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and annexing the living of ſo many particular Churches to the maintenance of their Cloyſters, Abbeyes and dignities, by their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian diſpenſations: Whereby they haue left the Miniſtrie ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilouſly vnprouided and ſo beggerly, as that in ſome places there are to be found many Pariſhes togither, wherof all the livings, that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to them, are not ſufficient for the competent maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of one Man and his familie. Which lamentable eſtate of our Church deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many from vndertaking that holy and honorable Function, vvho having ſufficient giftes, ſeeing the Miniſtry oppreſſed with beggery, and ſubiect to other diſcredit and inconveniences ariſing thereof, beſtovve themſelues in ſome other lawfull calling, wherein they may bee able to liue in wealth and credit. By which meanes the vnſufficient and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſtry ſeized vpon the poſſeſſions of the Church, to the infinite hinderance of the Goſpell, to the increaſe &amp; ſtrengthening of Poperie, and the loſſe of thouſands of Soules, which CHRIST IESVS thy deare Sonne hath bought with his precious blood. Alas, alas that the poore Pariſh, according vnto thy ordinance, giveth the Tithe of al they haue, to haue a Man of GOD amongſt them, who may teach them the righte way to ſerue and honor thee, and to ſaue their ſoules: alas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, that this Tithe ſhould be taken away and ſtill detained by the greedy Nabals &amp; hold-faſt Labans of the world, and applyed to profane vſes; leaving the poore ſpoyled of their goods, and the whole pariſh vnfurniſhed of one, who ſhould be their guide to everlaſting life: By which devilliſh cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes
